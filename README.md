# Chess Retrograde Analysis

Implementation of retrograde checkmate elimination algorithm for chess position analysis.

## Project Goal
Test the hypothesis that dead-end move elimination can propagate back through chess move trees to identify forced checkmate patterns.

## Algorithm Approach
- Breadth-First Search move generation
- Checkmate detection at each depth
- Predecessor move decrementing when checkmates found
- Dead-end tracking and propagation analysis

## Status
🚧 In Development

## Timeline
Week 1: Core BFS + checkmate detection
Week 2: Decrement logic + testing
Week 3: Optimization + documentation
